# multiplatform-gaming

## Notes on creating the base project

Currently Using the develop branch of cocos2d-x in github (3.0).

```
cd cocos2d-x
git checkout develop
git fetch
git merge origin/develop
git submodule init
git submodule update
./create-multi-platform-projects.py -p multiplatform-presentation -k com.gatillos.multiplatformpresentation -l javascript

  Open multiplatform-presentation/proj.ios_mac/HelloJavascript.xcodeproj
Run!
```


## iOS project notes

Particular to my case, because I want to have the project in a separate folder. Create a link cocos2dx to the COCOS2DX_ROOT, then changed all paths to point through that directory, as I couldn't use the environment variables to define it (#ugly).

##Â Android project notes

- Doesn't seem to copy javah builder. Edit `.project` and remove the external build (probably can be done via Eclipse). Can also be copied from other project. (`.externalToolBuilder` folder)
- If desired, edit `jni/Application.mk` to add more binaries
  - armeabi armeabi-v7a
- Defined in Preferences/C/C++/Build/Build Variables:
  - `NDK_ROOT=/Users/OAmat/Documents/code/android/ndk`
  - `COCOS2DX_ROOT=/Users/osuka/Documents/code/cocos2d-x`
- In environment defined them to export them as system variables
  - `NDK_ROOT=${NDK_ROOT}`
  - `COCOS2DX_ROOT=${COCOS2DX_ROOT}` 
- Lots of trouble because I move the project outside of the `cocos2d-x/projects folder`
  - Added `${ProjDirPath}/../Classes` to Properties/C/C++ General/Includes
  - Edited the `build_native.sh` paths to better reflect my structure (see below, remember to remove `obj/local`)

```
COCOS2DX_ROOT="${COCOS2DX_ROOT}"
APP_ROOT="$DIR/.."
APP_ANDROID_ROOT="$DIR"
BINDINGS_JS_ROOT="${COCOS2DX_ROOT}/scripting/javascript/bindings/js"
```

## Command line compiling for Android

```
cd proj.android
./build_native.sh
ant -Dsdk.dir=/Users/osuka/Documents/code/android/sdk/ debug install
```

## Eclipse compiling for Android

Open Android Developer Tools (Eclipse version, the other one doesn't support native code yet)

* Import -> Existing Android Code into Workspace
* Browse to `~/Documents/code/cocos2d-x/projects/multiplatform-presentation`
* It will find `proj.android.` Click finish
* You may have problems with Android versions. In theory it runs on 2.3+ (android 13). I'm going for API 14 (Android 4.0), just because I have a Kindle Fire HD. With no google APIs.
  * So, open Project properties and set SDK to 4.0
